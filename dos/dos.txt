- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
SQL Injection vulnerabilities arise when applications directly incorporate user input into SQL queries without proper validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL. This can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation. Secure versions prevent this by employing prepared statements and parameterized queries, which separate user input from the SQL code. This approach ensures that user input is treated strictly as data, not as part of the SQL command, effectively neutralizing the injection vector. By preventing attackers from altering the structure of SQL queries, the application maintains data integrity and security, safeguarding against unauthorized access or data tampering.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
To prevent SQL Injection and enhance security, incorporate input validation and sanitization, enforce least privilege access control, deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), conduct regular security audits and code reviews, use encryption for sensitive data, and implement secure error handling. These mechanisms collectively strengthen defense against unauthorized access and data manipulation.
