Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

SQL Injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries 
through unsanitized input, compromising data integrity. Secure versions use 
prepared statements to prevent this, upholding data integrity, a core aspect of
the CIA triad. Enhancing security with input validation, least privilege access, 
WAFs, audits, encryption, and secure error handling can further mitigate risks.
